        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm an ambitious full stack web developer driven by my passion for
          innovation and creating. I spend my time working in many different
          areas of web development, ranging from back end programming to front
          end engineering, user experience, and visual design. I'm extremely
          passionate about web development and software engineering in all its
          forms. I achieved a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science through
          Wayne State University's engineering program. Aside from my academic and professional
          career, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, studying philosophy, taking
          photos, and engaging myself in community events.
